Much of the time spent in this first week was on setting up efficient workflows for the upcoming weeks and planning on how to carry out
the project. Team leaders spent time in their respective teams, planning how they would approach the tasks at hand and delegating various
assignments to team members. Individually, people also spent time getting to grips with the libraries and other softwares they would be using
for the duration of the project.

While a significant portion of this week's work went into planning, each team began implementing concrete code. On the GUI side, Hugo familiarized
himself with Qt graphics libraries and then coded the main page for the API. On the linear systems team, a lot of progress was made, with Peixin, Aurele,
Hector finishing the Miller_Rabin algorithm, a class for matrices along with a variety of methods and also started work on an FFT algorithm.

On the Image recognition team, a lot of time was spent on understanding and installing openCV, while also planning how to approach the problem. The team
will begin coding the neural network in the following week. It remains to be seen how we will incorporate openCV on the main branch.
