This first week has involved creating a plan for the image recognition part of the project. It was decided we would first focus on image preprocessing as this
was a natural place to start. A more significant portion of the week was dedicated toward managing Git and getting to grips with openCV which was quite tedious
to install and get running on our machines. In future, we need to be able to have a buildable project on Git so that anyone could download it and have it work
without having to go through the entire process of installing Git. 

The main goal for next week is to have a proper working project on Git that works with openCV and finish up on any image preprocessing that remains and then begin to 
implement our neural network, hopefully writing functions for convolutions, pooling and fully connected layers in that order of priority.
